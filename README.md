# XOR Problem
This is my attempt to solve the XOR problem with a neural network created in C++ without any external libraries.
The neural network has one hidden layer with two neurons.

## What is the XOR problem?
XOR problem (exclusive or) is a problem where the output is true only if one of the inputs is true. 
´´´Input 1	Input 2	Output´´´
´´´0	0	0´´´
´´´0	1	1´´´
´´´1	0	1´´´
´´´1	1	0´´´
